# updated-portfolio-with-project1
This project is to showcase my previous work. Potential employers can see an easy to read profile listing some information about me, seeing previous projects, and finally having my contact information.

I built this project to develop an easy to ready profile for future employers. The profile is also a first step in building responsive websites. My motivation was to put what I have learned for far to the test .

This is my first project. I will be updating this portfolio with other projects done in and out of bootcamp. This gives me an idea on how a website needs to be planned and executed .

I learn about building and organizing both my HTML and CSS, Javascript, Work with 3-party API . It has been exiting to see how much knowledge I can apply my updated portfolio. 

Each one of the projects will take you to github where the projects are deployed. Please feel free to interact with my applications.
